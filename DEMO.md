- Point out the glassmorphism header with navigation
- Click "Connect Wallet" button in header
- Show Phantom wallet connection popup
- Successfully connect wallet
- Show wallet address displayed and "Connected to devnet" status

### 2. Setup & Test Tokens (45 seconds)

**[AI Voice]:** "For demo purposes, we need test tokens on devnet. The Setup page provides a one-click solution to create test tokens and receive SOL for transactions."

**[Actions]:**
- Navigate to `/setup` via header link
- Show the "Test Token Setup" section
- Click "Setup Test Tokens" button
- Wait for transaction confirmation
- Show success message with Token A and Token B addresses
- **Dialogue:** "Perfect! We now have test tokens: Token A and Token B with their respective addresses on Solana devnet."

### 3. Pool Discovery (30 seconds)

**[AI Voice]:** "Now let's discover existing DLMM pools. The Load Pools feature fetches real pool addresses from the Saros DLMM protocol."

**[Actions]:**
- Scroll to "Create New Position" section
- Click "Load Pools" button
- Show loading state
- Display dropdown populated with pool addresses
- Select a pool from dropdown
- **Dialogue:** "The system automatically fetches pool metadata and populates the token addresses for us."

### 4. Position Creation (60 seconds)

**[AI Voice]:** "Creating a DLMM position requires setting token addresses, liquidity amount, and bin range. Let me demonstrate a real position creation with actual blockchain transactions."

**[Actions]:**
- Show form with Token A and Token B addresses auto-populated
- Enter amount: "1"
- Select "Token A"
- Enter Lower Bin ID: "0"
- Enter Upper Bin ID: "5"
- **Dialogue:** "I'm setting a position with 1 token across bins 0 to 5, providing liquidity in this price range."
- Click "Preview Quote" button
- Show quote results (amount in, estimated out, price impact)
- **Dialogue:** "The quote shows our expected output and price impact before committing."
- Click "Create Position" button
- Show transaction processing state
- Display success message with transaction signature
- **Dialogue:** "Success! Our position is created. Let's verify this on Solana Explorer."
- Click the Solana Explorer link
- Show transaction details in new tab

### 5. Dashboard & Analytics (30 seconds)

**[AI Voice]:** "The dashboard provides comprehensive position analytics and real-time monitoring of your DLMM positions."

**[Actions]:**
- Navigate back to `/dashboard`
- Show position list with the newly created position
- Display position metrics (value, PnL, health status)
- Show performance charts and analytics
- **Dialogue:** "Here we can monitor position performance, track profits and losses, and manage our liquidity strategy."

### 6. Code Quality & Architecture (15 seconds)

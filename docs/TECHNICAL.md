# Saros LP Manager - Technical Documentation

## Architecture Overview

The Saros LP Manager is a sophisticated liquidity management application built on top of the Saros DLMM SDK. It provides advanced features for liquidity providers to manage their positions effectively.

### Core Components

1. **DLMM Service (`src/lib/saros/dlmm-service.ts`)**
   - Primary interface to the Saros DLMM SDK
   - Handles position creation, adjustment, and management
   - Implements proper error handling and type safety
   - Manages transaction building and signing

2. **Price Feed Service (`src/lib/saros/price-feed/service.ts`)**
   - Real-time price monitoring using DLMM bins
   - Calculates VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)
   - Provides historical price data
   - Implements efficient caching

3. **Position Metrics Service (`src/lib/saros/position-metrics.ts`)**
   - Real-time position analytics
   - Calculates impermanent loss
   - Monitors position health
   - Tracks fees and returns

4. **Rebalancing Service (`src/lib/saros/rebalancing/service.ts`)**
   - Multiple rebalancing strategies:
     - Symmetric: Equal distribution around active bin
     - Dynamic: Adjusts based on volatility
     - Concentrated: Focuses liquidity near active bin
   - Automated position adjustment
   - Market volatility monitoring

5. **Limit Orders Service (`src/lib/saros/limit-orders/service.ts`)**
   - Implements limit orders using DLMM bins
   - Single-bin position management
   - Order tracking and execution

### Advanced Features

#### 1. Limit Orders
- Uses single-bin positions for limit orders
- Automatically tracks order status
- Supports both buy and sell orders
- Efficient order cancellation

#### 2. Automated Rebalancing
- Multiple strategies:
  ```typescript
  export interface RebalanceStrategy {
    type: 'symmetric' | 'dynamic' | 'concentrated';
    targetUtilization: number;
    rebalanceThreshold: number;
    minBinSpread: number;
    maxBinSpread: number;
    concentrationFactor?: number;
  }
  ```
- Real-time market monitoring
- Volatility-based adjustments
- Gas-efficient rebalancing

#### 3. Position Health Monitoring
- Real-time health score calculation:
  ```typescript
  healthScore = (
    deviationScore * 0.4 +  // Distance from active bin
    coverageScore * 0.3 +   // Price range coverage
    liquidityWeight * 0.3    // Liquidity distribution
  );
  ```
- Multiple health factors:
  - Bin deviation
  - Price range coverage
  - Liquidity distribution
  - Volume utilization

### SDK Integration

The application uses multiple Saros SDKs:
1. `@saros-finance/dlmm-sdk`: Core DLMM functionality
2. `@saros-finance/sdk`: Additional utilities

Key SDK features utilized:
- Position management
- Liquidity provision
- Price discovery
- Pool metadata
- Bin management

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching**
   - Price data caching with TTL
   - Pool metadata caching
   - Position data caching

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Transaction batching for rebalancing
   - Bulk position updates
   - Efficient bin data fetching

3. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Transaction retry logic
   - Fallback mechanisms

### Security Considerations

1. **Transaction Safety**
   - All transactions are validated before sending
   - Proper signature handling
   - Transaction confirmation checks

2. **Input Validation**
   - Bin range validation
   - Price validation
   - Amount validation

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Transaction rollback support
   - State recovery mechanisms
   - Error reporting

### Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Portfolio optimization suggestions
   - Risk analysis
   - Performance predictions

2. **Additional Features**
   - Stop-loss orders
   - Take-profit orders
   - Advanced order types

3. **Integration Possibilities**
   - External price feeds
   - Cross-chain support
   - Additional DEX integrations
